# Data/Image Transfer Code
This is the sample code for data/image transfer.

Their operation detail put into their directory respectively.
Please go to the directory to read README, `image_transfer_code` and `data_transfer_code`.

The difference between these codes is that `image_transfer_code` is specific for transfering image data and `data_transfer_code` is for common type of data such as string, int, float, but not for image because there is no any image preprocessing in the code.

If any problem, it's welcome for everyone to contact me.
